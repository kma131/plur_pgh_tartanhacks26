## 🧮 Scoring Algorithm

The intelligent matching system uses a **weighted priority-based scoring approach**:

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Factor | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **1** (Highest) | User Preferences | +50 each | LGBT Friendly, Adult Club, Activity |
| **2** | Venue Type Match | +30 | Bar & Grill, Night Club, Live Music, etc. |
| **3** | Zip Code Match | +20 | Exact location proximity |
| **4** (Lowest) | Budget Compatibility | 0-15 | Price tier alignment |

### Budget Penalty System
- **More Expensive Than Budget**: -1000 points (automatic disqualification)
- **Exact Price Match**: +15 points
- **Cheaper Than Budget**: -5 points per price tier

### Example
A user in zip code 15213, with budget $$, interested in Night Clubs with LGBT and Adult Club preferences:

```
Venue: Underground Lounge
- LGBT Friendly (Yes):           +50
- Adult Club (Yes):              +50
- Night Club match:              +30
- Zip Code match (15213):        +20
- Price ($$):                    +15
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total Score:                     165 points ✓
```

The top 3 venues are returned sorted by total score.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Secret Key
The Flask app uses a secret key for session management. For production deployment, change:

```python
app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key-here'
```

To a strong, random value.

### Database Location
Database is created at:
```
app.db
```

This is an SQLite database stored in the project root.

### Debug Mode
By default, debug mode is enabled:
```python
app.run(debug=True)
```

For production, set `debug=False`.
